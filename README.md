# Gene Trees & Species Trees

LAGNiAppE workshop &#8226; Louisiana State University &#8226; April 24, 2025

## Software

[Software to download & install](0_software_info.md)

## Workshop materials

* [Phylogenetics tutorial](1_phylo_tutorial.md)
* [Turtle sequences](data/1_turtle_sequences.zip) (zip archive; in data/)

We might not get to this during the workshop, but if you want to play around with phylogenetic trees in RStudio:

* [Tree visualization tutorial](2_tree_viz.md)

## Optional datasets for further practice

If you want further practice, here are some additional files: alignments for the rest of the genes (the ones we didn't use in the tutorial) from the Spinks et al. Emydidae paper, and DNA sequences (FASTA files) for 6 genes for great apes.

In [data/](data/):

* Remaining turtle alignments
* Primate sequences
